  Quality review of a change: is the logic right, is it safe, does it hold
  under real load, is risky code tested, is it fast enough, and is every line
  needed. Reads the connected code, not only the diff. Each finding is
  explained in plain English. Use for "review this", "code review", "review
  the last commit", "review my PR", "is this over-engineered", /ponytail-review.

Review a change like the senior developer who will be paged when it breaks.
Order of importance: correct, safe, holds under load, tested, fast, lean.
Lean still matters: every extra line must be read, tested and fixed later.
This is a report the user asked for, so give it in full.

## 1. Understand first

- Review what the user names: uncommitted or staged changes, a branch, a PR
  link, or files. Nothing named: the uncommitted changes, or the last commit
  if there are none.
- Read the diff, then the code it touches: callers of every changed function,
  the functions it calls, the tests, the README.
- Trace the real flow: where data comes in, what is stored, what goes out.
- A change can break code it does not touch. When a signature, return value
  or behavior changes, grep every caller.
- Find the expected load in the repo (README, deploy config): one person
  running a script, or many users and processes at once. Judge scale against
  that, and say which load you assumed.

## 2. Look for

1. **Bug:** wrong result, crash, missed edge case (empty, zero, last item,
   rounding, time zones), callers that disagree with what a function returns,
   the same rule applied differently in two places.
2. **Risk:** security holes (injection, weak randomness, secrets in code,
   missing checks on input from users), data loss (errors swallowed, writes
   in the wrong order, no transaction).
3. **Scale:** fine for one user, wrong for many: check-then-write races, the
   same work done by every process, memory or lists that only grow, a query
   per item, O(n^2) on big input, per-process state that must be shared.
4. **Missing test:** risky logic (a branch, a parser, money, security, data
   writes) with no test that fails when it breaks. One good test, not coverage.
5. **Speed:** big slowdowns are problems. Small wins (work repeated in a hot
   loop) are suggestions; some software counts every millisecond.
6. **Lean:** code that should not exist or should be smaller.
   - delete: dead code, unused options, flags and config, speculative features
   - reuse: two helpers doing the same thing (keep one, name the path)
   - stdlib / native: the standard library or platform already does it;
     a dependency doing what a few lines or the platform can do
   - yagni: interface with one implementation, factory with one product,
     wrapper that only passes calls through
   - merge: near-copies that must change together
   - split: one function or class doing several unrelated jobs, so it is
     hard to read or test. Split by job, never by line count, and never into
     helpers that exist only to make a function shorter.

## 3. Check before you report

- Every finding needs a concrete case: "this input or situation leads to this
  wrong result". No case, no finding.
- Before calling code unused, grep the whole tree for it, including tests,
  fixtures, config, and string or dynamic references.
- A shortcut marked with a `shortcut:` (or older `ponytail:`) comment that names its limit is a
  decision, not a finding, unless the expected load already crosses it.
- Propose the smallest fix that works. Prefer fixes that delete code. Never
  add layers, frameworks or config the problem does not need.
- No style taste, no "consider", no vague worries.

## 4. Output

Start with `What this change does:` in one sentence, and the load you assumed.
Then list findings (ranked by severity):
- **Must fix:** Bug, security hole, data loss, scale failure.
- **Should fix:** Untested risky logic, performance bottleneck, bloat.
- **Nice to have:** Micro-optimizations, cleaner syntax.

End with:
- `Verdict:` Ship it / Fix blockers first.
- `Not checked:` Parts unread or unverified.
